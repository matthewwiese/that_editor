# Bisqwit's Text Editor
This is a fork of the [text editor Bisqwit wrote](https://github.com/bisqwit/that_editor) for use in his [Youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/Bisqwit).

Make sure to read the [original README](BISQWIT.md) at the time of the fork to get a better idea of his motivations.

It's mostly a project to have fun and get some practical familiarity with C++. I've removed the files related to DOS support, focusing entirely on Linux compatibility.

Modifications I've made:
- [X] English keyboard support (he hardcoded Finnish ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡®) *IDEA: Detect keyboard layout*
- [X] Status line shows a random fortune on startup
- [X] Format keymap doc to HTML page *IDEA: Further elucidate documentation*
